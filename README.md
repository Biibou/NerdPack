###Information:
NerdPack is divided by 2 kind of modules: Core ("Legal") and Protected ("Ilegal").  
Core modules will only tell you what to do (placing a icon on top of the spell to cast) and then you have to manualy press it.  
Protected modules will automate everything and therefore breaks WoW's TOS.
