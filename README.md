### Information:
NerdPack is the successor of ProbablyEngine, i created it for my own needs when PE was abandoned and then decided to open it up and support third party routines.
These days i dont do routines myself, i maintain and improve NerdPack and its modules, if you're looking for combat routines to use with NerdPack i recommend using the toolbox, asking on the discord channel or just build your own (TRY IT, ITS REALLY EASY!)

NerdPack is divided by 2 kind of modules: Core and Protected.
Core modules will only tell you what to do (placing a icon on top of the spell to cast) and then you have to manualy press it.
Protected module is required to automate everything.
